##Fallacies of relevance
###Ambiguity fallacy
Using ambiguous language/terminology in premises to lead to a misleading conclusion.

###Appeal to conspiracy fallacy
Proposes a secret plan among a number of people, generally to implement a nefarious scheme such as conspiring to hide a truth or perpetuate misinformation.

###Equivocation fallacy
When the same word (here used also for phrase) is used with two different meanings. Equivocation is a subset of the ambiguity fallacy.

###Non sequitur fallacy
Latin for “it does not follow” and applies to arguments where the stated conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

###Red herring fallacy
Poses a distracting statement that has little bearing on the final argued conclusion and whose intent is to disrupt engagement with the point at issue.

##Fallacies of presumption
###Fake experts fallacy
Cites dissenting non-experts who are promoted as highly qualified while not having published any actual climate research.

###False cause fallacy
Post hoc ergo propter hoc — after this therefore because of this. Automatically attributes causality to a sequence or conjunction of events.

###False dichotomy fallacy
Presents only two alternatives, while there may be another alternative, another way of framing the situation, or both options may be simultaneously viable.

###False equivalency fallacy
Assumes that two subjects that share a single trait are equivalent.

###Magnified minority
Presents a small dissenting group as larger and more significant than they really are.

##Fallacies of scope
###Cherry picking fallacy
Selectively chooses data leading to a desired conclusion that differs from the conclusion arising from all the available data. Similar to slothful induction but with an emphasis on actively selecting specific information to draw a misleading conclusion rather than ignoring relevant information.

###Impossible expectations fallacy
Demands unrealistic standards of certainty before acting on the science. In particular, expects deductive proof from inductive reasoning.

###Misrepresentation fallacy
Misrepresents a situation or scientific understanding.

###Oversimplification fallacy
A specific type of misrepresentation. Simplifies a situation in such a way as to distort scientific understanding, leading to erroneous conclusions. In contrast to cherry picking, which typically involves data, oversimplification typically involves understandings of how systems operate.

###Single cause fallacy
Assumes there is a single, simple cause of an outcome.

###Slothful induction fallacy
Ignores relevant and significant evidence when inferring to a conclusion. Similar to cherry picking but with an emphasis on neglecting information rather than selecting highlighting information to draw a misleading conclusion.
