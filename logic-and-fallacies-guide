##Fallacies of relevance
---
###Ambiguity fallacy
Using ambiguous language/terminology in premises to lead to a misleading conclusion.

###Appeal to conspiracy fallacy
Proposes a secret plan among a number of people, generally to implement a nefarious scheme such as conspiring to hide a truth or perpetuate misinformation.

###Equivocation fallacy
When the same word (here used also for phrase) is used with two different meanings. Equivocation is a subset of the ambiguity fallacy.

###Non sequitur fallacy
Latin for “it does not follow” and applies to arguments where the stated conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

###Red herring fallacy
Poses a distracting statement that has little bearing on the final argued conclusion and whose intent is to disrupt engagement with the point at issue.

##Fallacies of presumption
###Fake experts fallacy
Cites dissenting non-experts who are promoted as highly qualified while not having published any actual climate research.

###False cause fallacy
Post hoc ergo propter hoc — after this therefore because of this. Automatically attributes causality to a sequence or conjunction of events.

###False dichotomy fallacy
Presents only two alternatives, while there may be another alternative, another way of framing the situation, or both options may be simultaneously viable.

###False equivalency fallacy
Assumes that two subjects that share a single trait are equivalent.

###Magnified minority
Presents a small dissenting group as larger and more significant than they really are.

##Fallacies of scope
###Cherry picking fallacy
Selectively chooses data leading to a desired conclusion that differs from the conclusion arising from all the available data. Similar to slothful induction but with an emphasis on actively selecting specific information to draw a misleading conclusion rather than ignoring relevant information.

###Impossible expectations fallacy
Demands unrealistic standards of certainty before acting on the science. In particular, expects deductive proof from inductive reasoning.

###Misrepresentation fallacy
Misrepresents a situation or scientific understanding.

###Oversimplification fallacy
A specific type of misrepresentation. Simplifies a situation in such a way as to distort scientific understanding, leading to erroneous conclusions. In contrast to cherry picking, which typically involves data, oversimplification typically involves understandings of how systems operate.

###Single cause fallacy
Assumes there is a single, simple cause of an outcome.

###Slothful induction fallacy
Ignores relevant and significant evidence when inferring to a conclusion. Similar to cherry picking but with an emphasis on neglecting information rather than selecting highlighting information to draw a misleading conclusion.

##Cognitive Biases
---
###Fundamental Attribution Error
We judge others on their personality or fundamental character, but we judge ourselves on the situation.
"Sally is late to class, she's lazy. You're late to class, it was a bad morning."

###Self-Serving Bias
Our failure are situational, but our success are our responsibility
"You won that award due to hard work rather than help or luck. Meanwhile, you failed a test because you hadn't gotten enough sleep."

###In-Group Favoritism
We favor people who are in our in-group as opposed to an out-group
"Francis is in your church, so youl like Francis more than Sally"

###Bandwagon Effect
Ideas, fads and beliefs grow as more people adopt them
"Sally believs fidget spinners help her children. Francis does, too"

###Groupthink
Due to a desire for conformity and harmony in the group, we make irrational decisions often to minimize conflict.
"Sally wants to go get ice cream. Francis wants to shop for T-shirts. You suggest getting t-shirts with pictures of ice cream on them"

###Halo Effect
If you see a person as having a positive trait, that positive impression will spill over into their other traits (This also works for negative traits)
"Taylor could never be mean, she's so cute!"

###Moral Luck
Better moral standing happens due to a positive outcome, worse moral standing happens due to a negative outcome
"X culture won X war because they were morally superior to the losers"

###False Consensus
We believe more people agree with us than is actually the case
"Everybody thinks that!"

###Curse of Knowledge
Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too.
"Alice is a teacher and struggles to understand the perspective of her new students!

###Spotlight Effect
We overestimate how mich people are paying attention to our behavior and appearance
"Sally is worried everyone's going to notice how lame her ice cream T-shirt is"

###Availability Heuristic
We rely on immediate examples that come to minde while making judgments
"When tying to ecide on which store to visit, you choose the one you most recently saw an ad for"

###Defensive Attribution
As a witness who secretly fears being vulnerable to a serious mishap, we will blame the victim less and attacker more if we relate to the victim
#Sally sat too lang at a green light because she was playing with her phone. She got rear-ended. Greg who is known to text and drive, got out and yelled at the person who smacked into her"

###Just-World Hypothesis
We tend to believe the wolrd is just, therefore we assume acts of injustice are deserved
"Sally's purse was stolen because she was mean to Francis about the T-shirt and had bad karma"

###Naive Realism
We believe that we onserve objective reality and that other people are irrational uninformed or biased
"I see the world as it really is - other people are dumb"

###Forer Effect (aka Barnum Effect)
We easily attribtue our personalitites to vague statements, even if they can apply to a wide range of people
"This hroscope is so accurate!"

###Dunning Kruger Effect
The less you know the more confident you are. The more you know the less confident you are.
"Francis confidently assures the group that theres no kelp in ice cream. They do not work in the diary industry"

###Anchoring
We rely heavily on the first piece of information introduced when making decisions
"That's 50% off? It must be a great deal!"

###Automation Bias
We rely on automated systems, sometimes trusting too much in the automated correction of actually correct decisions.
"Your phone auto-corrects "its" to "it's" so you assume it's right"

###Google effect (aka Digital Amnesia)
We tend to forget information that's easily looked up in search engines
"What was the name of that actor in that funny movie? I've looked it up like eight times..."
