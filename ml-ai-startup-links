Prediction vs Causality: general problem of spurious correlations that falsely seem to imply causal link between observations

###Two biases of predictions (Prosperi et al., Nature Machine Intelligence, 2020):
Confounding bias: common cause for both exposure/predictor and outcome. AI would detect that lung cancer comes along with yellow fingers that both result from smoking, but getting normal skin color back does not heal cancer.
Collider bias: common effect of both exposure and outcome. Hospitalization status functions as a collider because it introduces selection bias, as people with locomotor disease or respiratory disease have a higher risk of being admitted to a hospital, but treating one will not heal the other.

###NLP###
natural language processing (NLP). NLP follows the steps below:

Tokenization: splits longer strings of text into smaller pieces, or tokens; larger chunks of text can be tokenized into sentences, sentences can be tokenized into words, etc.
Normalization: 
Word Stemming: eliminating affixes (suffixed, prefixes, infixes, circumfixes) from a word to obtain a word stem (infinitive, singular…)
Lemmatization: capture canonical forms based on a word’s lemma (e.g. better → good)
Set all characters to lowercase
Convert numbers to textual representations or vice versa
Remove punctuation 
Remove default stop words (articles, conjunctions etc.)
BERT – Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

Created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google
Original goal: better understand user searches
24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameter neural network architecture
Trained on BookCorpus with 800M words and English Wikipedia with 2,500M words
Deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation
Takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word, contextual model that generates a representation of each word that is based on the other words in the sentence
Not possible to train bidirectional models by simply conditioning each word on its previous and next words, since this would allow the word that’s being predicted to indirectly “see itself” in a multi-layer model
Solution: mask words and predict them (“Masked Language Modeling”)

##Sectors of the Canvas##
Customer segments: it is fundamental to have a crystal clear understanding of who the customer is. Having a customer centric approach is key for business success. What is your persona? What is your customer segment? What are the jobs that potential customers need to get done?
Customer relationships: depending on your product or service, you have to make sure to understand and build the most effective and long lasting relationship with your customer. Is your business a b2b or b2c? How do you approach your customers to ensure customer satisfaction and low churn rates?
Channels: it is important to understand how to engage with your customers, both on distribution and communication aspects. Do you use social media channels to spark engagement and advertise your products? Do you use common delivery methods or do you partner with some delivery companies?
Value proposition: this is the heart of any business model. The value proposition represents the business card for your customers, it is the promise you keep during your relationship with the customers. It explains the contribution to get the main customer’s job done. Which value do you want to deliver? What is your unfair advantage that makes your offering unique?
Key activities: it is nearly impossible to cover all the supply chain components yourself. Therefore, it is vital to focus on certain activities that can indeed lead to an unfair advantage and to a differentiation. It is worth outsourcing certain activities that are not at the core of your business. What is that I am really good at? What are the core activities on which it is especially important to pay attention?
Key resources: It is fundamental to identify the resources you rely on for the delivery of value to the customers. Resources needed can be very different depending on your business model. What are the key ingredients you need to deliver your offerings?
Key partners: especially in the early stage of a business, it is crucial to form strategic partnerships in order to focus your activities. Which companies or organizations could be useful for the delivery of high value products or services?

##Unfair advantage##
https://www.inc.com/chris-heivly/14-unfair-advantages-you-don-t-realize-your-startup-has.html
Passion. By definition, big companies lose most of their passion in their bureaucracy. Big company employees are less incentivized to stay that extra hour.
Intellect. You have been thinking about this idea and this product for a long time. You have explored every angle and used your network to validate certain truths. You are smarter than you think.
Experience. I love entrepreneurs that forge their idea from their own professional experiences. You lived on that front line. You have a considerable understanding of the customer that no one else can bring.
Willingness to Listen. The world is littered with startup founders who can pitch and pitch and pitch. But you can listen better than them and with that skill, you will uncover insights that others can't hear.
Curiosity. One of my favorite words and an even better trait is your innate curiosity about company building or customer development, or product development or financing, or . . . You get the picture. Curiosity is the launch point for great things.
Community. Great entrepreneurs use their community to create something bigger than themselves. There is power in many.
Realistic Goals. I push hard for 3-month goals; any longer and you risk building out a team that puts the cart before the horse. Set realistic goals for you and your team and the next thing you know, it's 2 years later and you have out-executed your peers.
1st Mover. See something no one else sees? Is your product or service so unique that replication would be futile? Get out fast and show the world what you got.
Flexibility. There is a fine line between focused and stubborn. At TSF we use the term malleability. Flexible is in the same family. A mix of personality traits that enables you to balance focus and new data is an advantage.
Exclusive Partnerships. Whether these are manufacturing partnerships or distribution partnerships, exclusive deals can create a great barrier to entry against your competitors.
Trade Secrets/Patents. I am not a fan of patents in software but anything that you can touch could/should be considered. The little brother (you know the one that is talented just younger) is the Trade Secret and that in many ways is even more powerful than the patent. What is a trade secret? Think Coca Cola recipe.
Networks. Your ability to get advice, help, funding, and hiring from a well established network is one of the least expensive but more powerful weapons you own.
Speed. Speed to anything is an unfair advantage and when you can sell , make or distribute your product faster than others you compete like no other.
Location. Where you operate many times provides advantages that others cannot replicate. This can play out in lower costs thus longer runway.
