Informations and resources about how to style stuff (PowerPoint, Webseits, etc.) better in a no effort way.


---Pictures---
--What do you have to look out for in pictures?--

Among other things, you must pay attention to the rights holders of the images with each publication. Do you have the permission of the photographer to publish and use the pictures? Are all photographed persons consenting to the publication? Etc.etc.
There are different licenses for photos. For example, Creative Common issues free licenses here. For example, CC0 photos can be freely used for commercial and non-commercial purposes. However, there are also restrictions such as CC NC (non-commercial). More information can be found on Wikipedia: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#CC_Zero

Through portals like Shutterstock you can also buy pictures or the rights of use and licenses for money, usually these are also very professionally processed.

For example, you can obtain CC0 licensed images through the portal pixabay.com. These are not always perfect, but you can often find free alternatives to Shutterstock.
pexels.com is another alternative.

---PowerPoint---
